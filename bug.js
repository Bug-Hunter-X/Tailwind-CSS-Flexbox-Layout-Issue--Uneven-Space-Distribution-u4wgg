```javascript
<div class="flex">
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 w-1/2"></div>
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS classes to create a flex container with two equally sized divs. However, if you inspect the rendered output, you might notice that the divs might not always split the space exactly 50/50, especially if the content inside the divs varies in length.

This is because Tailwind's `w-1/2` class only sets the width to approximately 50% of the available space, and any rounding errors or extra padding can cause uneven distribution.
